**Serena:** <br>
[Saftey Application Research](Sprint1/sprint1_safetyappresearch.pdf): This research is to be used as a kickoff point in coding in React Native. There are bare-bones applications and example code of components we've discussed using for our applications. <br> 
[Web vs Mobile Capabilities](Sprint1/WebVsMobile.txt): This is a brief summary of how our throught process evolved from Web application to Mobile application.

**Abel:** <br>
<a href="Sprint1/TestGif1.gif" target="_blank">App Rough Draft Design with UX Software</a>: First test of possible layout for app. Built inside of Adobe XD using the cool tones color scheme to show how the UI might look like. <br>
<a href="Sprint1/TestGif2.gif" target="_blank">App Rough Draft Design with UX Software</a>: Second text with another possible color scheme and UI that incorporated some suggestions from the team. <br>
<a href="https://cs3398-s19-klingon-warriors.github.io/Out-of-the-Woods/">Implement color scheme and logo into HTML/CSS</a>: A small web demo that allows you to press the SOS button that would send your location to contacts. An adaptation of the second design draft, but with a new logo decided by the team. **Make sure when opening that you go into developer tools and select the mobile development option. The site is still funtional at desktop size, but it will not look correct. This is because it is a demo of a React Native application, which is purely on mobile phones.**<br>

<a href="Sprint1/OOTW_Cool_Tones.jpg" target="_blank">Cool Tones</a>: Color Scheme Mock-Up created for the Out of the Woods App to be less active to the eyes. Benefit: Blues tend to ease the mind. Drawback: Blue light is harmful to the eye.<br>
<a href="Sprint1/OOTW_Forest_Tones.jpg" target="_blank">Forest Tones</a>: Color Scheme Mock-Up created to be more vibrant and active to the eyes. Benefit: This color palette is representative of strength. Drawback: Not enough contrast between colors for accessibility.
**Mock-Ups are a Culmination of Research**: Color & Design Theory Research<br>

**Rachel:** <br>
<a href="Sprint1/WAI mobile accessibility.pdf" target="_blank">WAI Mobile Accessibility Notes</a>: General Notes and research on WAI accessibility standards and mobile mapping. WAI standards are language and platform independent. These notes contain the accessibility features most pertinent to our app that we should code in and keep tracking as we go.<br>
<a href="Sprint1/Color Contrast Check test notes 3.3 pdf.pdf" target="_blank">Contrast Test Notes, Cool Tones</a>: Notes from color contrast tests with cool tones palette. Checked variety of background and foreground colors from our Cool Tones palette (and a few other standard colors) with WAI online contrast checking tool. This document has the results from those tests. We will need to avoid color pairings with an insufficient contrast ratio in our future designs.<br>
<a href="Sprint1/Contrast Tests Screenshots.zip" target="_blank">Contrast Test Screenshots, Cool Tones</a>: Screenshots from WebAIM test page of each cool tones contrast test. This contains labeled screenshots from each color test. The screenshots make it much easier to see which colors were being tested against each other, how they looked, and how good/bad the test results were.<br>
