We had initially decided to do a Web Browser based on our personal 
capabilities and experiences. However, the more we discussed the 
functionality of the application and what we would like to accomplish, 
the decision became clear to us that this was meant to be a mobile 
application.

For an example, some things that were considered:

* If this service has geolocation - how does the location tracking 
work if they're logged into their browser of their phone or on a 
computer?
* How would we deliver notifications to the user if the application 
were to be checking in with them?
