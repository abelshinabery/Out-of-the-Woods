# Out of the Woods

## Vision Statement

 _Out of the Woods_ , a personal safety mobile application that can help people avoid risky situations whilst being independent.

## Project Description

_Goal:_ Creating a personal safety mobile application to alleviate stress and mitigate harm as a result of precarious or unpredictable situations.

## How it will work:
>  The application will send a notification to an emergency contact if the user : doesn’t arrive at their designated destination, thinks they are in danger, or just wants a friend to know their location. A user can preemptively set up an alert before entering an unsafe situation, or do it in the moment. Our goal is for users to achieve independence without sacrificing their own safety. Out of the Woods is gender inclusive and meant to improve quality of life for travelers, hikers, blind-daters, and families.
# Where idea started
This idea was inspired by the modern surge of online dating. From dating applications such as Tinder or Bumble, to friendships blossoming from message boards such as Reddit, it is no longer a social stigma to say you’ve met someone “from the internet”. However, just because its a new norm of our generation doesn’t mean that meeting up with someone from online is 100% safe.


# Who we are:
We are the Klingons, a group of undergraduate Computer Science students at Texas State University. In and throughout the semester we will use this repository to work on our project and software engineering principles as well as gain experience working in an agile environment.

**Currently: Under construction, a.**

**Serena:** <br>
Status: Preparing to start coding in React Native <br>
Next Steps: Set up individual development branch, finish determining user flow and parsing out individual work pages.

**Talon:** <br>
Status: Setting up React Native and my developement branch.<br>
Next Steps: Determine user flow and code a page (TBD).

**Rachel:** <br>
Status: Still wrapping up Sprint 1 tasks: Aria/JS research document and user flow document
Tabled HTML alt text task (not in board) since HTML has to be redone/ported to React in Sprint 2. <br>
Next steps: Finish Sprint 1 tasks. Write JavaScript accessibility guidelines so we can code in needed functionality as we go, rather than after the fact. Get Expo emulator running on phone.

**Abel:** <br>
Status: Working on turning our HTML/CSS demo into a React Native Application <br>
Next Steps: Need to study up on file structure and components to make sure the team is on the same page about where to put components they make and how to access them.
