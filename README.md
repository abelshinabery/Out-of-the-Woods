## Vision Statement

_Out of the Woods_, a personal safety mobile application that can help people avoid risky situations whilst being independent.

## Project Description

_Goal:_ Creating a personal safety mobile application to alleviate stress and mitigate harm as a result of precarious or unpredictable situations.

## How it will work:
The application will send a notification to an emergency contact if the user : doesn’t arrive at their designated destination, thinks they are in danger, or just wants a friend to know their location. A user can preemptively set up an alert before entering an unsafe situation, or do it in the moment. Our goal is for users to achieve independence without sacrificing their own safety. Out of the Woods is gender inclusive and meant to improve quality of life for travelers, hikers, blind-daters, and families.

# Where idea started
This idea was inspired by the modern surge of online dating. From dating applications such as Tinder or Bumble, to friendships blossoming from message boards such as Reddit, it is no longer a social stigma to say you’ve met someone “from the internet”. However, just because its a new norm of our generation doesn’t mean that meeting up with someone from online is 100% safe.


# Who we are:
We are the Klingons, a group of undergraduate Computer Science students at Texas State University. In and throughout the semester we will use this repository to work on our project and software engineering principles as well as gain experience working in an agile environment.

**Currently: Under construction**

### Status + Next Steps
To see individual contributions and artifacts: [Click here](https://github.com/cs3398-s19-klingon-warriors/Out-of-the-Woods/tree/shared/Docs)<br><br>
**Project Status:** Mobile app is implemented with React Native and running. Minimal features at the moment, but the structure is there and some functionality. We have the frames and design ready in the app to add or refine features. 

**Serena:** <br>
Status: Feeling good about React Native capabilities and development workflow - working on homepage. <br>
Next Steps: Flesh out rest of needs for project completion - (Navigation component, backend solutions, etc) and cleaning up styling issues

_Sprint3 Progress_: <br>
4/12: 2 hours <br>
4/15: 2 hours <br>
4/16: 1 hour <br>

**Talon:** <br>
Status: Updating pages to reflect demo mockups. Currently working on Home and Registration Pages.<br>
Next Steps: After finishing the React styles for layouts and arranging components, I will begin assisting with logic (button mapping, database querying, etc).

**Rachel:** <br>
Status: Created large gitignore, concrete code changes suggested for BigButton accessibility. Unfortunately, after 8+ hours of troubleshooting still cannot get foo-app working in Expo on local machine, which meant it was too risky to change source code directly. Will look for other software/simulator options next. Other Sprint tasks complete and have a good sense of what's next.<br>
Next steps: Continue trying to fix Expo access, or find alternative options to display app (maybe an IDE/Simulator). Once able to see the app, implement accessibility suggestions for BigButton into the code and test all with mobile screen readers - those may not be implemented in just a simulator and may need to borrow test phones that have Expo working to test accessibility. Integrate what we've learned about mobile accessibility into the new features and pages we'll be adding during the last sprint.

**Abel:** <br>
Status: Working on adding functionality to the SOS button on the homepage.<br>
Next Steps: Planning on building functions to send location info to contacts.

**Sarah:**<br>
__Sprint 2__
Status: Confirmed that the entire team is able to develop and run OOTW on their personal machines. Got Expo(the react native toolkit) running in visual studio on Windows 10 and made alot of readme docs for the team to follow on how to get set up with react native and expo. Added logo to homepage and implemented registration page that plays nicely with the keyboard when you input text.

Next Steps: Add simple react-native-timer-countdown component and implement the functionallity to set, disable and store timer features.

__Sprint 1__<br>
Status: Created and pushed a skeleton-file structure of components, screens and navigation for team to pull (on shared branch as well as set branch to upstream for team to pull from and work on dev branches) [App](https://github.com/cs3398-s19-klingon-warriors/Out-of-the-Woods/tree/master/App). Added README with how to set up development environment with __Expo__ and __React Native__.
<br>
Next Step: Following up with team to make sure everyone has development environment configured on personal machines and pulled app/ skeleton file structure to own dev branch and is able to run on personal machine and iphone/android. Next next step is determine how best to include css with react-native + javascript (probably reading up on javascript for this).
